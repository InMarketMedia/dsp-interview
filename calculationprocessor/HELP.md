## GraphQL code generation with DGS

This project has been configured to use the Netflix DGS Codegen plugin.
This plugin can be used to generate client files for accessing remote GraphQL services.
The default setup assumes that the GraphQL schema file for the remote service is added to
the `src/main/resources/graphql-client/` location.

You can learn more about
the [plugin configuration options](https://netflix.github.io/dgs/generating-code-from-schema/#configuring-code-generation)
and
[how to use the generated types](https://netflix.github.io/dgs/generating-code-from-schema/) to adapt the default setup.

### Docker Compose support

This project contains a Docker Compose file named `compose.yaml`.
In this file, the following services have been defined:

* postgres: [`postgres:latest`](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)

Please review the tags of the used images and set them to the same as you're running in production.
